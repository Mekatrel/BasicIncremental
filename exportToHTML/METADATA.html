<span class="s0"># `pyinstaller-hooks-contrib`: The PyInstaller community hooks repository</span>

<span class="s0">What happens when (your?) package doesn't work with PyInstaller? Say you have data files that you need at runtime?</span>
<span class="s0">PyInstaller doesn't bundle those. Your package requires others which PyInstaller can't see? How do you fix that?</span>

<span class="s0">In summary, a &quot;hook&quot; file extends PyInstaller to adapt it to the special needs and methods used by a Python package.</span>
<span class="s0">The word &quot;hook&quot; is used for two kinds of files. A runtime hook helps the bootloader to launch an app, setting up the</span>
<span class="s0">environment. A package hook (there are several types of those) tells PyInstaller what to include in the final app -</span>
<span class="s0">such as the data files and (hidden) imports mentioned above.</span>

<span class="s0">This repository is a collection of hooks for many packages, and allows PyInstaller to work with these packages</span>
<span class="s0">seamlessly.</span>


<span class="s0">## Installation</span>

<span class="s0">`pyinstaller-hooks-contrib` is automatically installed when you install PyInstaller, or can be installed with pip:</span>

<span class="s0">```commandline</span>
<span class="s0">pip install -U pyinstaller-hooks-contrib</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>


<span class="s0">## I can't see a hook for `a-package`</span>

<span class="s0">Either `a-package` works fine without a hook, or no-one has contributed hooks.</span>
<span class="s0">If you'd like to add a hook, or view information about hooks,</span>
<span class="s0">please see below.</span>


<span class="s0">## I want to help!</span>

<span class="s0">If you've got a hook you want to share then great!</span>
<span class="s0">The rest of this page will walk you through the process of contributing a hook.</span>
<span class="s0">If you've been here before then you may want to skip to the [summary checklist](#summary)</span>

<span class="s0">**Unless you are very comfortable with `git rebase -i`, please provide one hook per pull request!**</span>
<span class="s0">**If you have more than one then submit them in separate pull requests.**</span>


<span class="s0">### Setup</span>

<span class="s0">[Fork this repo](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller-hooks-contrib/fork) if you haven't already done so.</span>
<span class="s0">(If you have a fork already but its old, click the **Fetch upstream** button on your fork's homepage.)</span>
<span class="s0">Clone and `cd` inside your fork by running the following (replacing `bob-the-barnacle` with your github username):</span>

<span class="s0">```</span>
<span class="s0">git clone https://github.com/bob-the-barnacle/pyinstaller-hoooks-contrib.git</span>
<span class="s0">cd pyinstaller-hooks-contrib</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">Create a new branch for you changes (replacing `foo` with the name of the package):</span>
<span class="s0">You can name this branch whatever you like.</span>

<span class="s0">```</span>
<span class="s0">git checkout -b hook-for-foo</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">If you wish to create a virtual environment then do it now before proceeding to the next step.</span>

<span class="s0">Install this repo in editable mode.</span>
<span class="s0">This will overwrite your current installation.</span>
<span class="s0">(Note that you can reverse this with `pip install --force-reinstall pyinstaller-hooks-contrib`).</span>

<span class="s0">```</span>
<span class="s0">pip install -e .</span>
<span class="s0">pip install -r requirements-test.txt</span>
<span class="s0">pip install flake8</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">Note that on macOS and Linux, `pip` may by called `pip3`.</span>
<span class="s0">If you normally use `pip3` and `python3` then use `pip3` here too.</span>
<span class="s0">You may skip the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; line if you have no intention of providing tests (but please do provide tests!).</span>


<span class="s0">### Add the hook</span>

<span class="s0">Standard hooks live in the [src/_pyinstaller_hooks_contrib/hooks/stdhooks/](../master/src/_pyinstaller_hooks_contrib/hooks/stdhooks/) directory.</span>
<span class="s0">Runtime hooks live in the [src/_pyinstaller_hooks_contrib/hooks/rthooks/](../master/src/_pyinstaller_hooks_contrib/hooks/rthooks/) directory.</span>
<span class="s0">Simply copy your hook into there.</span>
<span class="s0">If you're unsure if your hook is a runtime hook then it almost certainly is a standard hook.</span>

<span class="s0">Please annotate (with comments) anything unusual in the hook.</span>
<span class="s0">*Unusual* here is defined as any of the following:</span>

<span class="s0">*   Long lists of `hiddenimport` submodules.</span>
    <span class="s0">If you need lots of hidden imports then use [`collect_submodules('foo')`](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hooks.html#PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_submodules).</span>
    <span class="s0">For bonus points, track down why so many submodules are hidden. Typical causes are:</span>
    <span class="s0">*   Lazily loaded submodules (`importlib.importmodule()` inside a module `__getattr__()`).</span>
    <span class="s0">*   Dynamically loaded *backends*.</span>
    <span class="s0">*   Usage of `Cython` or Python extension modules containing `import` statements.</span>
<span class="s0">*   Use of [`collect_all()`](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hooks.html#PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_all).</span>
    <span class="s0">This function's performance is abismal and [it is broken by</span>
    <span class="s0">design](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/6458#issuecomment-1000481631) because it confuses</span>
    <span class="s0">packages with distributions.</span>
    <span class="s0">Check that you really do need to collect all of submodules, data files, binaries, metadata and dependencies.</span>
    <span class="s0">If you do then add a comment to say so (and if you know it - why).</span>
    <span class="s0">Do not simply use `collect_all()` just to *future proof* the hook.</span>
<span class="s0">*   Any complicated `os.path` arithmetic (by which I simply mean overly complex filename manipulations).</span>


<span class="s0">#### Add the copyright header</span>

<span class="s0">All source files must contain the copyright header to be covered by our terms and conditions.</span>

<span class="s0">If you are **adding** a new hook (or any new python file), copy/paste the appropriate copyright header (below) at the top</span>
<span class="s0">replacing 2021 with the current year.</span>

<span class="s0">&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;GPL 2 header for standard hooks or other Python files.&lt;/summary&gt;</span>

<span class="s0">```python</span>
<span class="s0"># ------------------------------------------------------------------</span>

<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">&lt;/details&gt;</span>

<span class="s0">&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;APL header for runtime hooks only.</span>
<span class="s0">Again, if you're unsure if your hook is a runtime hook then it'll be a standard hook.&lt;/summary&gt;</span>

<span class="s0">```python</span>
<span class="s0"># ------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="s0"># Copyright (c) 2021 PyInstaller Development Team.</span>

<span class="s0"># ------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">&lt;/details&gt;</span>


<span class="s0">If you are **updating** a hook, skip this step.</span>
<span class="s0">Do not update the year of the copyright header - even if it's out of date.</span>


<span class="s0">### Test</span>

<span class="s0">Having tests is key to our continuous integration.</span>
<span class="s0">With them we can automatically verify that your hook works on all platforms, all Python versions and new versions of</span>
<span class="s0">libraries as and when they are released.</span>
<span class="s0">Without them, we have no idea if the hook is broken until someone finds out the hard way.</span>
<span class="s0">Please write tests!!!</span>

<span class="s0">Some user interface libraries may be impossible to test without user interaction</span>
<span class="s0">or a wrapper library for some web API may require credentials (and possibly a paid subscription) to test.</span>
<span class="s0">In such cases, don't provide a test.</span>
<span class="s0">Instead explain either in the commit message or when you open your pull request why an automatic test is impractical</span>
<span class="s0">then skip on to [the next step](#run-linter).</span>


<span class="s0">#### Write tests(s)</span>

<span class="s0">A test should be the least amount of code required to cause a breakage</span>
<span class="s0">if you do not have the hook which you are contributing.</span>
<span class="s0">For example if you are writing a hook for a library called `foo`</span>
<span class="s0">which crashes immediately under PyInstaller on `import foo` then `import foo` is your test.</span>
<span class="s0">If `import foo` works even without the hook then you will have to get a bit more creative.</span>
<span class="s0">Good sources of such minimal tests are introductory examples</span>
<span class="s0">from the documentation of whichever library you're writing a hook for.</span>
<span class="s0">Package's internal data files and hidden dependencies are prone to moving around so</span>
<span class="s0">tests should not explicitly check for presence of data files or hidden modules directly -</span>
<span class="s0">rather they should use parts of the library which are expected to use said data files or hidden modules.</span>

<span class="s0">Tests currently all live in [src/_pyinstaller_hooks_contrib/tests/test_libraries.py](../master/src/_pyinstaller_hooks_contrib/tests/test_libraries.py).</span>
<span class="s0">Navigate there and add something like the following, replacing all occurrences of `foo` with the real name of the library.</span>
<span class="s0">(Note where you put it in that file doesn't matter.)</span>

<span class="s0">```python</span>
<span class="s0">@importorskip('foo')</span>
<span class="s0">def test_foo(pyi_builder):</span>
    <span class="s0">pyi_builder.test_source(&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

        <span class="s0"># Your test here!</span>
        <span class="s0">import foo</span>

        <span class="s0">foo.something_fooey()</span>

    <span class="s0">&quot;&quot;&quot;)</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">If the library has changed significantly over past versions then you may need to add version constraints to the test.</span>
<span class="s0">To do that, replace the `@importorskip(&quot;foo&quot;)` with a call to `PyInstaller.utils.tests.requires()` (e.g.</span>
<span class="s0">`@requires(&quot;foo &gt;= 1.4&quot;)`) to only run the test if the given version constraint is satisfied.</span>
<span class="s0">Note that `@importorskip` uses module names (something you'd `import`) whereas `@requires` uses distribution names</span>
<span class="s0">(something you'd `pip install`) so you'd use `@importorskip(&quot;PIL&quot;)` but `@requires(&quot;pillow&quot;)`.</span>
<span class="s0">For most packages, the distribution and packages names are the same.</span>


<span class="s0">#### Run the test locally</span>

<span class="s0">Running our full test suite is not recommended as it will spend a very long time testing code which you have not touched.</span>
<span class="s0">Instead, run tests individually using either the `-k` option to search for test names:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span>
<span class="s0">pytest -k test_foo</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">Or using full paths:</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>
<span class="s0">pytest src/_pyinstaller_hooks_contrib/tests/test_libraries.py::test_foo</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>


<span class="s0">#### Pin the test requirement</span>

<span class="s0">Get the version of the package you are working with (`pip show foo`)</span>
<span class="s0">and add it to the [requirements-test-libraries.txt](../master/requirements-test-libraries.txt) file.</span>
<span class="s0">The requirements already in there should guide you on the syntax.</span>


<span class="s0">#### Run the test on CI/CD</span>

<span class="s0">To test hooks on all platforms we use Github's continuous integration (CI/CD).</span>
<span class="s0">Our CI/CD is a bit unusual in that it's triggered manually and takes arguments</span>
<span class="s0">which limit which tests are run.</span>
<span class="s0">This is for the same reason we filter tests when running locally -</span>
<span class="s0">the full test suite takes ages.</span>

<span class="s0">First push the changes you've made so far.</span>

<span class="s0">```commandline</span>
<span class="s0">git push --set-upstream origin hook-for-foo</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">Replace *billy-the-buffalo* with your Github username in the following url then open it.</span>
<span class="s0">It should take you to the `oneshot-test` actions workflow on your fork.</span>
<span class="s0">You may be asked if you want to enable actions on your fork - say yes.</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>
<span class="s0">https://github.com/billy-the-buffalo/pyinstaller-hooks-contrib/actions/workflows/oneshot-test.yml</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">Find the **Run workflow** button and click on it.</span>
<span class="s0">If you can't see the button,</span>
<span class="s0">select the **Oneshot test** tab from the list of workflows on the left of the page</span>
<span class="s0">and it should appear.</span>
<span class="s0">A dialog should appear containing one drop-down menu and 5 line-edit fields.</span>
<span class="s0">This dialog is where you specify what to test and which platforms and Python versions to test on.</span>
<span class="s0">Its fields are as follows:</span>

<span class="s0">1.  A branch to run from. Set this to the branch which you are using (e.g. ``hook-for-foo``),</span>
<span class="s0">2.  Which package(s) to install and their version(s).</span>
    <span class="s0">Which packages to test are inferred from which packages are installed.</span>
    <span class="s0">You can generally just copy your own changes to the `requirements-test-libraries.txt` file into this box.</span>
    <span class="s0">* Set to `foo` to test the latest version of `foo`,</span>
    <span class="s0">* Set to `foo==1.2, foo==2.3` (note the comma) to test two different versions of `foo` in separate jobs,</span>
    <span class="s0">* Set to `foo bar` (note the lack of a comma) to test `foo` and `bar` in the same job,</span>
<span class="s0">3.  Which OS or OSs to run on</span>
    <span class="s0">* Set to `ubuntu` to test only `ubuntu`,</span>
    <span class="s0">* Set to `ubuntu, macos, windows` (order is unimportant) to test all three OSs.</span>
<span class="s0">4.  Which Python version(s) to run on</span>
    <span class="s0">* Set to `3.9` to test only Python 3.9,</span>
    <span class="s0">* Set to `3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9` to test all currently supported version of Python.</span>
<span class="s0">5.  The final two options can generally be left alone.</span>

<span class="s0">Hit the green **Run workflow** button at the bottom of the dialog, wait a few seconds then refresh the page.</span>
<span class="s0">Your workflow run should appear.</span>

<span class="s0">We'll eventually want to see a build (or collection of builds) which pass on</span>
<span class="s0">all OSs and all Python versions.</span>
<span class="s0">Once you have one, hang onto its URL - you'll need it when you submit the pull request.</span>
<span class="s0">If you can't get it to work - that's fine.</span>
<span class="s0">Open a pull request as a draft, show us what you've got and we'll try and help.</span>


<span class="s0">#### Triggering CI/CD from a terminal</span>

<span class="s0">If you find repeatedly entering the configuration into Github's **Run workflow** dialog arduous</span>
<span class="s0">then we also have a CLI script to launch it.</span>
<span class="s0">Run ``python scripts/cloud-test.py --help`` which should walk you through it.</span>
<span class="s0">You will have to enter all the details again but, thanks to the wonders of terminal history,</span>
<span class="s0">rerunning a configuration is just a case of pressing up then enter.</span>


<span class="s0">### Run Linter</span>

<span class="s0">We use `flake8` to enforce code-style.</span>
<span class="s0">`pip install flake8` if you haven't already then run it with the following.</span>
<span class="s0">Note that this assumes that you did create a new branch in the [setup step](#setup).</span>

<span class="s0">```</span>
<span class="s0">git diff -U0 master | flake8 --diff -</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">No news is good news.</span>
<span class="s0">If it complains about your changes then do what it asks then run it again.</span>
<span class="s0">If you don't understand the errors it come up with them lookup the error code</span>
<span class="s0">in each line (a capital letter followed by a number e.g. `W391`).</span>

<span class="s0">If it complains about code which you haven't written,</span>
<span class="s0">or if you didn't create a new branch at the start then, using `git log`,</span>
<span class="s0">find the commit ID of the newest commit which you didn't write, copy it</span>
<span class="s0">and replace `master` in the above command with that ID.</span>

<span class="s0">```</span>
<span class="s0">git diff -U0 a5d3841c282fa23fd68c3d6a85519e73c08acb4a | flake8 --diff -</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">**Please do not fix flake8 issues found in parts of the repository other than the bit that you are working on.** Not only is it very boring for you, but it is harder for maintainers to</span>
<span class="s0">review your changes because so many of them are irrelevant to the hook you are adding or changing.</span>


<span class="s0">### Add a news entry</span>

<span class="s0">Please read [news/README.txt](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller-hooks-contrib/blob/master/news/README.txt) before submitting you pull request.</span>
<span class="s0">This will require you to know the pull request number before you make the pull request.</span>
<span class="s0">You can usually guess it by adding 1 to the number of [the latest issue or pull request](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller-hooks-contrib/issues?q=sort%3Acreated-desc).</span>
<span class="s0">Alternatively, [submit the pull request](#submit-the-pull-request) as a draft,</span>
<span class="s0">then add, commit and push the news item after you know your pull request number.</span>


<span class="s0">### Summary</span>

<span class="s0">A brief checklist for before submitting your pull request:</span>

<span class="s0">* [ ] All new Python files have [the appropriate copyright header](#add-the-copyright-header).</span>
<span class="s0">* [ ] You have written a [news entry](#add-a-news-entry).</span>
<span class="s0">* [ ] Your changes [satisfy the linter](#run-linter) (run `git diff -U0 master | flake8 --diff -`).</span>
<span class="s0">* [ ] You have written tests (if possible), [pinned the test requirement](#pin-the-test-requirement) and linked to a successful CI build.</span>


<span class="s0">### Submit the pull request</span>

<span class="s0">Once you've done all the above, go ahead and create a pull request.</span>
<span class="s0">If you're stuck doing any of the above steps, create a draft pull request and explain what's wrong - we'll sort you out...</span>
<span class="s0">Feel free to copy/paste commit messages into the Github pull request title and description.</span>
<span class="s0">If you have run CI/CD, please include a link to it in your description so that we can see that it works.</span>
<span class="s0">If you've never done a pull request before, note that you can edit it simply by running `git push` again.</span>
<span class="s0">No need to close the old one and start a new one.</span>

<span class="s0">---</span>
