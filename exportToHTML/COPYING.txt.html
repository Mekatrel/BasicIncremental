<span class="s0">PyInstaller is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License</span>
<span class="s0">as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,</span>
<span class="s0">or (at your option) any later version.</span>


<span class="s0">Bootloader Exception</span>
<span class="s0">--------------------</span>

<span class="s0">In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the</span>
<span class="s0">authors give you unlimited permission to link or embed compiled bootloader</span>
<span class="s0">and related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute</span>
<span class="s0">those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those</span>
<span class="s0">files. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects;</span>
<span class="s0">for example, they cover modification of the files, and distribution when</span>
<span class="s0">not linked into a combined executable.)</span>
 
 
<span class="s0">Bootloader and Related Files</span>
<span class="s0">----------------------------</span>

<span class="s0">Bootloader and related files are files which are embedded within the</span>
<span class="s0">final executable. This includes files in directories:</span>

<span class="s0">./bootloader/</span>
<span class="s0">./PyInstaller/loader</span>


<span class="s0">Run-time Hooks</span>
<span class="s0">----------------------------</span>

<span class="s0">Run-time Hooks are a different kind of files embedded within the final</span>
<span class="s0">executable. To ease moving them into a separate repository, or into the</span>
<span class="s0">respective project, these file are now licensed under the Apache License,</span>
<span class="s0">Version 2.0.</span>

<span class="s0">Run-time Hooks are in the directory</span>
<span class="s0">./PyInstaller/hooks/rthooks</span>

 
<span class="s0">About the PyInstaller Development Team</span>
<span class="s0">--------------------------------------</span>

<span class="s0">The PyInstaller Development Team is the set of contributors</span>
<span class="s0">to the PyInstaller project. A full list with details is kept</span>
<span class="s0">in the documentation directory, in the file</span>
<span class="s0">``doc/CREDITS.rst``.</span>

<span class="s0">The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:</span>
<span class="s0">https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller.  As of 2021, it consists of:</span>

<span class="s0">* Hartmut Goebel</span>

<span class="s0">Our Copyright Policy</span>
<span class="s0">--------------------</span>

<span class="s0">PyInstaller uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright</span>
<span class="s0">over their contributions to PyInstaller. But, it is important to note that these</span>
<span class="s0">contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,</span>
<span class="s0">the PyInstaller source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single</span>
<span class="s0">person or institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire</span>
<span class="s0">PyInstaller Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain</span>
<span class="s0">a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they</span>
<span class="s0">should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they</span>
<span class="s0">commit the change to the PyInstaller repository.</span>

<span class="s0">With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file</span>
<span class="s0">to indicate the copyright and license terms:</span>

		    <span class="s0">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span>
		       <span class="s0">Version 2, June 1991</span>

 <span class="s0">Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</span>
 <span class="s0">51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA</span>
 <span class="s0">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</span>
 <span class="s0">of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span>

			    <span class="s0">Preamble</span>

  <span class="s0">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</span>
<span class="s0">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</span>
<span class="s0">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</span>
<span class="s0">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</span>
<span class="s0">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</span>
<span class="s0">Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to</span>
<span class="s0">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</span>
<span class="s0">the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</span>
<span class="s0">your programs, too.</span>

  <span class="s0">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span>
<span class="s0">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span>
<span class="s0">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span>
<span class="s0">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</span>
<span class="s0">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</span>
<span class="s0">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</span>

  <span class="s0">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span>
<span class="s0">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</span>
<span class="s0">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span>
<span class="s0">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span>

  <span class="s0">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span>
<span class="s0">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</span>
<span class="s0">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</span>
<span class="s0">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</span>
<span class="s0">rights.</span>

  <span class="s0">We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</span>
<span class="s0">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</span>
<span class="s0">distribute and/or modify the software.</span>

  <span class="s0">Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain</span>
<span class="s0">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</span>
<span class="s0">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span>
<span class="s0">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</span>
<span class="s0">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</span>
<span class="s0">authors' reputations.</span>

  <span class="s0">Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</span>
<span class="s0">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</span>
<span class="s0">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</span>
<span class="s0">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</span>
<span class="s0">patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</span>

  <span class="s0">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span>
<span class="s0">modification follow.</span>

		    <span class="s0">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span>
   <span class="s0">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span>

  <span class="s0">0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</span>
<span class="s0">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</span>
<span class="s0">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</span>
<span class="s0">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</span>
<span class="s0">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</span>
<span class="s0">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</span>
<span class="s0">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</span>
<span class="s0">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span>

<span class="s0">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span>
<span class="s0">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</span>
<span class="s0">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</span>
<span class="s0">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</span>
<span class="s0">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span>

  <span class="s0">1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's</span>
<span class="s0">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</span>
<span class="s0">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</span>
<span class="s0">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</span>
<span class="s0">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</span>
<span class="s0">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</span>
<span class="s0">along with the Program.</span>

<span class="s0">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</span>
<span class="s0">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span>

  <span class="s0">2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</span>
<span class="s0">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</span>
<span class="s0">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</span>
<span class="s0">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
    <span class="s0">stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span>

    <span class="s0">b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</span>
    <span class="s0">whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</span>
    <span class="s0">part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</span>
    <span class="s0">parties under the terms of this License.</span>

    <span class="s0">c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</span>
    <span class="s0">when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</span>
    <span class="s0">interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</span>
    <span class="s0">announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</span>
    <span class="s0">notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</span>
    <span class="s0">a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</span>
    <span class="s0">these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</span>
    <span class="s0">License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</span>
    <span class="s0">does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span>
    <span class="s0">the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span>

<span class="s0">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</span>
<span class="s0">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</span>
<span class="s0">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</span>
<span class="s0">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</span>
<span class="s0">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</span>
<span class="s0">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
<span class="s0">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</span>
<span class="s0">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span>

<span class="s0">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</span>
<span class="s0">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</span>
<span class="s0">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</span>
<span class="s0">collective works based on the Program.</span>

<span class="s0">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</span>
<span class="s0">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</span>
<span class="s0">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</span>
<span class="s0">the scope of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</span>
<span class="s0">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</span>
<span class="s0">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</span>
    <span class="s0">source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</span>
    <span class="s0">1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>

    <span class="s0">b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</span>
    <span class="s0">years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</span>
    <span class="s0">cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</span>
    <span class="s0">machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</span>
    <span class="s0">distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</span>
    <span class="s0">customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>

    <span class="s0">c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</span>
    <span class="s0">to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</span>
    <span class="s0">allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</span>
    <span class="s0">received the program in object code or executable form with such</span>
    <span class="s0">an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</span>

<span class="s0">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span>
<span class="s0">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</span>
<span class="s0">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</span>
<span class="s0">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</span>
<span class="s0">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</span>
<span class="s0">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</span>
<span class="s0">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</span>
<span class="s0">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</span>
<span class="s0">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</span>
<span class="s0">itself accompanies the executable.</span>

<span class="s0">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</span>
<span class="s0">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</span>
<span class="s0">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</span>
<span class="s0">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</span>
<span class="s0">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span>

  <span class="s0">4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</span>
<span class="s0">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</span>
<span class="s0">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</span>
<span class="s0">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</span>
<span class="s0">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</span>
<span class="s0">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</span>
<span class="s0">parties remain in full compliance.</span>

  <span class="s0">5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span>
<span class="s0">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
<span class="s0">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</span>
<span class="s0">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
<span class="s0">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</span>
<span class="s0">the Program or works based on it.</span>

  <span class="s0">6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<span class="s0">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</span>
<span class="s0">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>
<span class="s0">restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.</span>
<span class="s0">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</span>
<span class="s0">this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span>
<span class="s0">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</span>
<span class="s0">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span>
<span class="s0">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span>
<span class="s0">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</span>
<span class="s0">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</span>
<span class="s0">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</span>
<span class="s0">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</span>
<span class="s0">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</span>
<span class="s0">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</span>
<span class="s0">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</span>
<span class="s0">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</span>

<span class="s0">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</span>
<span class="s0">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</span>
<span class="s0">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</span>
<span class="s0">circumstances.</span>

<span class="s0">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</span>
<span class="s0">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</span>
<span class="s0">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</span>
<span class="s0">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</span>
<span class="s0">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</span>
<span class="s0">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</span>
<span class="s0">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</span>
<span class="s0">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</span>
<span class="s0">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</span>
<span class="s0">impose that choice.</span>

<span class="s0">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</span>
<span class="s0">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</span>
<span class="s0">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</span>
<span class="s0">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</span>
<span class="s0">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</span>
<span class="s0">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</span>
<span class="s0">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</span>
<span class="s0">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</span>
<span class="s0">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</span>
<span class="s0">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</span>
<span class="s0">address new problems or concerns.</span>

<span class="s0">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</span>
<span class="s0">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</span>
<span class="s0">later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</span>
<span class="s0">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</span>
<span class="s0">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</span>
<span class="s0">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</span>
<span class="s0">Foundation.</span>

  <span class="s0">10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</span>
<span class="s0">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</span>
<span class="s0">to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</span>
<span class="s0">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</span>
<span class="s0">make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</span>
<span class="s0">of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</span>
<span class="s0">of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</span>

			    <span class="s0">NO WARRANTY</span>

  <span class="s0">11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</span>
<span class="s0">FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</span>
<span class="s0">OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</span>
<span class="s0">PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</span>
<span class="s0">OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</span>
<span class="s0">MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</span>
<span class="s0">TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</span>
<span class="s0">PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</span>
<span class="s0">REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span>

  <span class="s0">12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</span>
<span class="s0">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</span>
<span class="s0">REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</span>
<span class="s0">INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</span>
<span class="s0">OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</span>
<span class="s0">TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</span>
<span class="s0">YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</span>
<span class="s0">PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</span>
<span class="s0">POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</span>

      <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

   <span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
      <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>

      <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>

      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
      <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
      <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
      <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
      <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>

   <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
      <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>
