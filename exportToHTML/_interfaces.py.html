    <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
    The common interface expected for all event loops. 
 
    .. caution:: 
       This is an internal, low-level interface. It may change 
       between minor versions of gevent. 
 
    .. rubric:: Watchers 
 
    The methods that create event loop watchers are `io`, `timer`, 
    `signal`, `idle`, `prepare`, `check`, `fork`, `async_`, `child`, 
    `stat`. These all return various types of :class:`IWatcher`. 
 
    All of those methods have one or two common arguments. *ref* is a 
    boolean saying whether the event loop is allowed to exit even if 
    this watcher is still started. *priority* is event loop specific. 
    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Run the event loop. 
 
        This is usually called automatically by the hub greenlet, but 
        in special cases (when the hub is *not* running) you can use 
        this to control how the event loop runs (for example, to integrate 
        it with another event loop). 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">now():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        now() -&gt; float 
 
        Return the loop's notion of the current time. 
 
        This may not necessarily be related to :func:`time.time` (it 
        may have a different starting point), but it must be expressed 
        in fractional seconds (the same *units* used by :func:`time.time`). 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">update_now():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Update the loop's notion of the current time. 
 
        .. versionadded:: 1.3 
           In the past, this available as ``update``. This is still available as 
           an alias but will be removed in the future. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">destroy():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Clean up resources used by this loop. 
 
        If you create loops 
        (especially loops that are not the default) you *should* call 
        this method when you are done with the loop. 
 
        .. caution:: 
 
            As an implementation note, the libev C loop implementation has a 
            finalizer (``__del__``) that destroys the object, but the libuv 
            and libev CFFI implementations do not. The C implementation may change. 
 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Create and return a new IO watcher for the given *fd*. 
 
        *events* is a bitmask specifying which events to watch 
        for. 1 means read, and 2 means write. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">closing_fd(fd):</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Inform the loop that the file descriptor *fd* is about to be closed. 
 
        The loop may choose to schedule events to be delivered to any active 
        IO watchers for the fd. libev does this so that the active watchers 
        can be closed. 
 
        :return: A boolean value that's true if active IO watchers were 
           queued to run. Closing the FD should be deferred until the next 
           run of the eventloop with a callback.

        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Create and return a timer watcher that will fire after *after* seconds. 
 
        If *repeat* is given, the timer will continue to fire every *repeat* seconds. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Create and return a signal watcher for the signal *signum*, 
        one of the constants defined in :mod:`signal`. 
 
        This is platform and event loop specific. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Create and return a watcher that fires before the event loop 
        polls for IO. 
 
        .. caution:: This method is not supported by libuv. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">check(ref=</span><span class="s3">True, </span><span class="s1">priority=</span><span class="s3">None</span><span class="s1">):</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Create and return a watcher that fires after the event loop 
        polls for IO. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">fork(ref=</span><span class="s3">True, </span><span class="s1">priority=</span><span class="s3">None</span><span class="s1">):</span>

        Create a watcher that fires when the process forks.

        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Create a watcher that fires when triggered, possibly 
        from another thread. 
 
        .. versionchanged:: 1.3 
           This was previously just named ``async``; for compatibility 
           with Python 3.7 where ``async`` is a keyword it was renamed. 
           On older versions of Python the old name is still around, but 
           it will be removed in the future. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

            <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
            Create a watcher that fires for events on the child with process ID *pid*. 
 
            This is platform specific and not available on Windows. 
 
            Availability: Unix. 
            &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
        Run the *func* passing it *args* at the next opportune moment.

        Like :meth:`run_callback`, but for use from *outside* the 
        thread that is running this loop. 
 
        This not only schedules the *func* to run, it also causes the 
        loop to notice that the *func* has been scheduled (e.g., it causes 
        the loop to wake up).

        When the event is detected, *callback* will be called with

        .. caution:: 
 
            Not all watchers accept ``**kwargs``,
