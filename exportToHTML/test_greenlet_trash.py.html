Tests for greenlets interacting with the CPython trash can API. 
 
The CPython trash can API is not designed to be re-entered from a 
single thread. But this can happen using greenlets, if something 
during the object deallocation process switches greenlets, and this second 
greenlet then causes the trash can to get entered again. Here, we do this 
very explicitly, but in other cases (like gevent) it could be arbitrarily more 
complicated: for example, a weakref callback might try to acquire a lock that's 
already held by another greenlet; that would allow a greenlet switch to occur. 
 
See https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues/1909 
 
This test is fragile and relies on details of the CPython 
implementation (like most of the rest of this package): 
 
    - We enter the trashcan and deferred deallocation after 
      ``_PyTrash_UNWIND_LEVEL`` calls. This constant, defined in 
      CPython's object.c, is generally 50. That's basically how many objects are required to 
      get us into the deferred deallocation situation. 
 
    - The test fails by hitting an ``assert()`` in object.c; if the 
      build didn't enable assert, then we don't catch this. 
 
    - If the test fails in that way, the interpreter crashes.
