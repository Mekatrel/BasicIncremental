<span class="s0"># Searching for Tcl Modules. Defines a procedure, declares it as the primary</span>
<span class="s0"># command for finding packages, however also uses the former 'package unknown'</span>
<span class="s0"># command as a fallback.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Locates all possible packages in a directory via a less restricted glob. The</span>
<span class="s0"># targeted directory is derived from the name of the requested package, i.e.</span>
<span class="s0"># the TM scan will look only at directories which can contain the requested</span>
<span class="s0"># package. It will register all packages it found in the directory so that</span>
<span class="s0"># future requests have a higher chance of being fulfilled by the ifneeded</span>
<span class="s0"># database without having to come to us again.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># We do not remember where we have been and simply rescan targeted directories</span>
<span class="s0"># when invoked again. The reasoning is this:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># - The only way we get back to the same directory is if someone is trying to</span>
<span class="s0">#   [package require] something that wasn't there on the first scan.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#   Either</span>
<span class="s0">#   1) It is there now:  If we rescan, you get it; if not you don't.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#      This covers the possibility that the application asked for a package</span>
<span class="s0">#      late, and the package was actually added to the installation after the</span>
<span class="s0">#      application was started. It shoukld still be able to find it.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#   2) It still is not there: Either way, you don't get it, but the rescan</span>
<span class="s0">#      takes time. This is however an error case and we dont't care that much</span>
<span class="s0">#      about it</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#   3) It was there the first time; but for some reason a &quot;package forget&quot; has</span>
<span class="s0">#      been run, and &quot;package&quot; doesn't know about it anymore.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#      This can be an indication that the application wishes to reload some</span>
<span class="s0">#      functionality. And should work as well.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Note that this also strikes a balance between doing a glob targeting a</span>
<span class="s0"># single package, and thus most likely requiring multiple globs of the same</span>
<span class="s0"># directory when the application is asking for many packages, and trying to</span>
<span class="s0"># glob for _everything_ in all subdirectories when looking for a package,</span>
<span class="s0"># which comes with a heavy startup cost.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>

    <span class="s0"># can still add bogus paths, by specifying them in a single call. This</span>
