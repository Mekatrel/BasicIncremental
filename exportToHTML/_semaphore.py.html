    Semaphore(value=1) -&gt; Semaphore 
 
    .. seealso:: :class:`BoundedSemaphore` for a safer version that prevents 
       some classes of bugs. If unsure, most users should opt for `BoundedSemaphore`. 
 
    A semaphore manages a counter representing the number of `release` 
    calls minus the number of `acquire` calls, plus an initial value. 
    The `acquire` method blocks if necessary until it can return 
    without making the counter negative. A semaphore does not track ownership 
    by greenlets; any greenlet can call `release`, whether or not it has previously 
    called `acquire`. 
 
    If not given, ``value`` defaults to 1. 
 
    The semaphore is a context manager and can be used in ``with`` statements. 
 
    This Semaphore's ``__exit__`` method does not call the trace function 
    on CPython, but does under PyPy. 
 
    .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0 
        Document that the order in which waiters are awakened is not specified. It was not 
        specified previously, but due to CPython implementation quirks usually went in FIFO order. 
    .. versionchanged:: 1.5a3 
       Waiting greenlets are now awakened in the order in which they waited. 
    .. versionchanged:: 1.5a3 
       The low-level ``rawlink`` method (most users won't use this) now automatically 
       unlinks waiters before calling them. 
    .. versionchanged:: 20.12.0 
       Improved support for multi-threaded usage. When multi-threaded usage is detected, 
       instances will no longer create the thread's hub if it's not present.
