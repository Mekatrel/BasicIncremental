        Except for those members given new values by whichever keyword 
        arguments are specified. For example, if ``d == date(2002, 12, 31)``, then 
        ``d.replace(day=26) == date(2000, 12, 26)``. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">timetuple():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return a 9-element tuple of the form returned by `time.localtime`. 
 
        The hours, minutes and seconds are 0, and the DST flag is -1. 
        ``d.timetuple()`` is equivalent to 
        ``(d.year, d.month, d.day, 0, 0, 0, d.weekday(), d.toordinal() - 
        date(d.year, 1, 1).toordinal() + 1, -1)``

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">toordinal():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return the proleptic Gregorian ordinal of the date 
 
        January 1 of year 1 has ordinal 1. For any date object *d*,

        Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. For example,

        .. seealso:: `isoweekday`. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">isoweekday():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return the day of the week as an integer. 
 
        Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7. For example, 
        date(2002, 12, 4).isoweekday() == 3, a Wednesday. 
 
        .. seealso:: `weekday`, `isocalendar`. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">isocalendar():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return a 3-tuple, (ISO year, ISO week number, ISO weekday). 
 
        The ISO calendar is a widely used variant of the Gregorian calendar. 
        See http://www.phys.uu.nl/~vgent/calendar/isocalendar.htm for a good 
        explanation. 
 
        The ISO year consists of 52 or 53 full weeks, and where a week starts 
        on a Monday and ends on a Sunday. The first week of an ISO year is the 
        first (Gregorian) calendar week of a year containing a Thursday. This 
        is called week number 1, and the ISO year of that Thursday is the same 
        as its Gregorian year. 
 
        For example, 2004 begins on a Thursday, so the first week of ISO year 
        2004 begins on Monday, 29 Dec 2003 and ends on Sunday, 4 Jan 2004, so 
        that ``date(2003, 12, 29).isocalendar() == (2004, 1, 1)`` and 
        ``date(2004, 1, 4).isocalendar() == (2004, 1, 7)``. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">isoformat():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return a string representing the date in ISO 8601 format. 
 
        This is 'YYYY-MM-DD'. 
        For example, ``date(2002, 12, 4).isoformat() == '2002-12-04'``. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">__str__():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;For a date *d*, ``str(d)`` is equivalent to ``d.isoformat()``.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">ctime():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return a string representing the date. 
 
        For example date(2002, 12, 4).ctime() == 'Wed Dec 4 00:00:00 2002'. 
        d.ctime() is equivalent to time.ctime(time.mktime(d.timetuple())) 
        on platforms where the native C ctime() function 
        (which `time.ctime` invokes, but which date.ctime() does not invoke) 
        conforms to the C standard. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">strftime(format):</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return a string representing the date. 
 
        Controlled by an explicit format string. Format codes referring to 
        hours, minutes or seconds will see 0 values. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;This is the datetime class interface.

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">today():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return the current local datetime, with tzinfo None. 
 
        This is equivalent to ``datetime.fromtimestamp(time.time())``. 
 
        .. seealso:: `now`, `fromtimestamp`. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">now(tz=</span><span class="s3">None</span><span class="s1">):</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return the current local date and time. 
 
        If optional argument *tz* is None or not specified, this is like `today`, 
        but, if possible, supplies more precision than can be gotten from going 
        through a `time.time` timestamp (for example, this may be possible on 
        platforms supplying the C ``gettimeofday()`` function). 
 
        Else tz must be an instance of a class tzinfo subclass, and the current 
        date and time are converted to tz's time zone. In this case the result 
        is equivalent to tz.fromutc(datetime.utcnow().replace(tzinfo=tz)). 
 
        .. seealso:: `today`, `utcnow`. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">utcnow():</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return the current UTC date and time, with tzinfo None. 
 
        This is like `now`, but returns the current UTC date and time, as a 
        naive datetime object. 
 
        .. seealso:: `now`. 
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">fromtimestamp(timestamp</span><span class="s3">, </span><span class="s1">tz=</span><span class="s3">None</span><span class="s1">):</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return the local date and time corresponding to the POSIX timestamp. 
 
        Same as is returned by time.time(). If optional argument tz is None or 
        not specified, the timestamp is converted to the platform's local date 
        and time, and the returned datetime object is naive. 
 
        Else tz must be an instance of a class tzinfo subclass, and the 
        timestamp is converted to tz's time zone. In this case the result is 
        equivalent to 
        ``tz.fromutc(datetime.utcfromtimestamp(timestamp).replace(tzinfo=tz))``. 
 
        fromtimestamp() may raise `ValueError`, if the timestamp is out of the 
        range of values supported by the platform C localtime() or gmtime() 
        functions. It's common for this to be restricted to years in 1970 
        through 2038. Note that on non-POSIX systems that include leap seconds 
        in their notion of a timestamp, leap seconds are ignored by 
        fromtimestamp(), and then it's possible to have two timestamps 
        differing by a second that yield identical datetime objects. 
 
        .. seealso:: `utcfromtimestamp`.

    <span class="s3">def </span><span class="s1">utcfromtimestamp(timestamp):</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return the UTC datetime from the POSIX timestamp with tzinfo None. 
 
        This may raise `ValueError`, if the timestamp is out of the range of

        in tz's local time. 
 
        tz must be an instance of a tzinfo subclass, and its utcoffset() and 
        dst() methods must not return None. self must be aware (self.tzinfo 
        must not be None, and self.utcoffset() must not return None). 
 
        If self.tzinfo is tz, self.astimezone(tz) is equal to self: no 
        adjustment of date or time members is performed. Else the result is 
        local time in time zone tz, representing the same UTC time as self: 
 
            after astz = dt.astimezone(tz), astz - astz.utcoffset() 
 
        will usually have the same date and time members as dt - dt.utcoffset(). 
        The discussion of class `datetime.tzinfo` explains the cases at Daylight Saving 
        Time transition boundaries where this cannot be achieved (an issue only 
        if tz models both standard and daylight time). 
 
        If you merely want to attach a time zone object *tz* to a datetime *dt* 
        without adjustment of date and time members, use ``dt.replace(tzinfo=tz)``. 
        If you merely want to remove the time zone object from an aware 
        datetime dt without conversion of date and time members, use 
        ``dt.replace(tzinfo=None)``. 
 
        Note that the default `tzinfo.fromutc` method can be overridden in a 
        tzinfo subclass to effect the result returned by `astimezone`.
