Implementation of the standard :mod:`threading` using greenlets. 
 
.. note:: 
 
    This module is a helper for :mod:`gevent.monkey` and is not 
    intended to be used directly. For spawning greenlets in your 
    applications, prefer higher level constructs like 
    :class:`gevent.Greenlet` class or :func:`gevent.spawn`. Attributes 
    in this module like ``__threading__`` are implementation artifacts subject 
    to change at any time. 
 
.. versionchanged:: 1.2.3 
 
   Defer adjusting the stdlib's list of active threads until we are 
   monkey patched. Previously this was done at import time. We are 
   documented to only be used as a helper for monkey patching, so this should 
   functionally be the same, but some applications ignore the documentation and 
   directly import this module anyway. 
 
   A positive consequence is that ``import gevent.threading, 
   threading; threading.current_thread()`` will no longer return a DummyThread 
   before monkey-patching.
